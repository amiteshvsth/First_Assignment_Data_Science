    "1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
    "In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another without any explicit instruction from the user. \n",

    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports several types of loops, primarily for and while loops, which allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. \n",
    "Each type of loop serves different purposes and has different use cases. Here’s an overview of these loops along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for Loop\n",
    "A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. \n",
    "It is particularly useful when you know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating over elements of a collection\n",
    "Repeating a block of code a specific number of times\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Iterating over a list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",

    "Example 3: Using range function\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. while Loop\n",
    "A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the given condition is True. \n",
    "It is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",

    "Loop Control Statements\n",
    "Python provides several control statements that change the execution flow of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "break: Exits the loop immediately\n",
    "continue: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration\n",
    "else: Executes a block of code once when the loop is exhausted (not terminated by break)\n",

    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using continue\n",
